Web Socket:
Coinbase has a web-socket and a REST - python SDK, documentation:

https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/advanced-trade-api/docs/sdk-rest-overview#getting-started-with-your-first-trading-strategy

Progress:

- We are using a web socket from Coinbase as our source of data, Coinbase has a python SDK that makes this incredibly simple. 
- Once we get the data through the web socket, we produce this to a Kafka topic
